# Message Encryption Project

Hello! I'm excited to introduce you to the **Streamlit Message Encryption Project**. As a student at the University of Cape Town, I've created this Python project to demonstrate how we can encrypt user input messages into cipher text. The main goal here is to showcase how messages can be securely stored without using any databases. Let's dive in and explore the magic of encryption! 🌟

## Overview

In this project, I've leveraged Streamlit, a powerful Python library for building interactive web applications. Users can input their messages, which are then encrypted using a secret key. The encrypted messages are displayed right on the screen, and we've intentionally avoided any database integration to keep things simple.

## Features

- **User Input**: Type in your message, and let the encryption begin!
- **Encryption**: We transform your messages into cipher text using a secret key.
- **No Database Required**: Yep, you read that right! We're not using any databases for this project.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Our trusty language for coding.
- **Streamlit**: The magic wand for creating the user interface.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get started by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Install Streamlit using `pip install streamlit`.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `streamlit run main.py`.
   - Access the application in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

4. **Encrypt Messages**:
   - Type in your message and press `Enter`.
   - Voilà! Your encrypted message appears.
